# Credible or not?

As part of the [Hack The Press Hackathon](https://hackthepress.org/) our team of four developers wanted to design an easy-to-use chrome extension visible on news websites, to ascertain whether the site is credible or not before you read it!

#### Outcome
In one weekend, we successfully built a chrome extension to display a variety of metrics (provided by [Glitched.news](https://glitched.news)) for the user to judge whether an online news article is credible or not.
