# Credible or not?

As part of the [Hack The Press Hackathon](https://hackthepress.org/) our team wanted to design a chrome extension visible on news websites to ascertain whether the site is credible or not before you read it!

#### Outcome
We successfully built the chrome extension to display a variety of metrics (provided by https://glitched.news) for the user to judge whether an online news article is credible or not.
